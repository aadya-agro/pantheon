6. Expense Automation – Redefining Effortless Tracking

Problem
Currently, expense management apps require users to enter data manually. This is time-consuming and leads to incomplete tracking.

Proposed Solution

Design a solution to automate expense entry and reduce manual effort for users. This could include:

Reading data from multiple sources, such as SMS, emails, notifications, digital receipts, or bank statements etc, to auto-generate expense entries.

Employing intelligent categorization to tag expenses automatically (e.g., “Swiggy” → Food, “Uber” → Travel).

Hackathon MVP

No redundancy in captured data

Privacy and security of user information

Accuracy of automation and categorization

# 💸 Expense Automation – Redefining Effortless Tracking

## 🚀 Problem

Most expense management apps require users to **manually enter expenses**, which is:

* Time-consuming
* Error-prone
* Often leads to incomplete tracking

This results in **poor financial insights** and missed opportunities for better money management.

---

## 💡 Proposed Solution

We are building an **Expense Automation Engine** that automatically:

* **Extracts** expense data from multiple sources (SMS, emails, receipts, bank statements)
* **Categorizes** expenses intelligently using rule-based + AI models
* **Logs** expenses seamlessly without user intervention
* **Visualizes** data in a clean, intuitive dashboard

---

## ✨ Key Features

* 🔄 **Multi-source data extraction** (SMS, emails, notifications, receipts, CSV uploads)
* 🧠 **AI-powered categorization** (e.g., Swiggy → Food, Uber → Travel)
* 📊 **Real-time expense dashboard** with category breakdowns & trends
* 🛡 **Privacy-first design** (end-to-end encryption, local-first OCR)
* 🧹 **No duplicate entries** (smart redundancy checks)
* 🛠 **User control** (manual overrides, custom categories & budgets)

## 🏆 Hackathon MVP

For the hackathon, we aim to build:

1. **Data source integration** → SMS & Email parsing
2. **Auto-expense logging** → Generate structured entries automatically
3. **Categorization** → Rule-based + lightweight ML categorizer
4. **Dashboard** → Display categorized expenses in a minimal UI

✅ Core requirements:

* No redundancy in captured data
* Privacy and security of user information
* Accuracy of automation and categorization

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

* **Frontend (Dashboard):** React.js / Next.js
* **Backend & APIs:** Node.js + Express
* **Database:** MongoDB (flexible schema for expense data)
* **ML Categorization:** Python (spaCy / scikit-learn) or TensorFlow\.js
* **OCR (for receipts):** Tesseract.js or Google Vision API
* **Security:** JWT Auth + AES Encryption for sensitive fields

---

## 📌 Future Enhancements

* 📱 UPI app & direct bank API integrations
* 🔔 Smart notifications → “You spent ₹5,000 this week on Food, 20% higher than usual.”
* 🤖 AI-powered budgeting assistant
* ☁️ Multi-device sync & cloud backup
